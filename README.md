# Diophantine equation
- In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually in two or more unknowns, such that only the integer solutions are required.

1. - Given three integers a, b, c representing a linear equation of the form : ax + by = c. Determine if the equation has a solution such that x and y are both integral values.
2. - Given a, b and n. Find x and y that satisfies ax + by = n. Print any of the x and y satisfying the equation
